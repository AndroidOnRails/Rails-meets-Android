# Rails-meets-Android

In this project, Android App will make a POST request to the server (hosted at “http://hmkcode.appspot.com/jsonservlet“) which renders data in JSON format and Rails App will parse this JSON format data!!

Android is hitting request everytime to the server and the information is parsed and rnedered (at local host: You can create your own) in Rails Web App....
Implies Android and Rails are communicating with each other via JSON once again!!
